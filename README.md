- 👋 Hi, I’m @zeysrt
- 👀 Student of Computer Engineering
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Blender and Java 
- 💫 Ok, I've been thinking about starting for a long time. There's a saying: "Crazy people go far until smart people think to do it." I will follow exactly that.
- 🤞🏻 My new year aim is (as a start) commit here every single day in Jnuary. That means I will code everyday for a month.
- ☐ January (Still progressing...)
